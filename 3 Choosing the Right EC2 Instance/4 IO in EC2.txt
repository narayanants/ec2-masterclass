IO in EC2:
==========

* I/O is the concept of writing or reading from a disk.
* Latency
* I/O Performance
* IOPS


When is I/O used?
-----------------

* Any time the application will read and write to disk, IO will be used.
* As startup, the OS will read from the disk
* iostat
* IO are heavily used by databases.

* If IO is not large enough, you will get
	
	- Timeouts
	- Slowdowns
	- Crashes
	
IO in EC2:
==========

* Some machines come with attached disks or optimized to read from EBS volumes.
* These machines are I generation (Currently I3) - SSD Backed Instance storage optimized for low latency, very high random IO.
* Other machines that support high IO are of H or D (MapReduce,HDFS,Big Data, Kafka)
