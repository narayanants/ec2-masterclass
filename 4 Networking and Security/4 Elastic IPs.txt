Elastic IPs:
------------

	- When you stop and start an EC2 instance, it can change its public IP.
	- Have a fixed IP for the instance, like Elastic IP
	- Attach one Elastic IP to one instance
	- try avoiding the usage of Elastic IP
	
		- Poor architectural Decisions
		- Use Random Public IP or DNS name to it.
		- Use a ELB and don't use a Public IP
		
Pricing:
--------

	- You don't pay as long as the Elastic IP is attached to a running EC2 instance.
	- You start paying if the EC2 instance is stopped.
