Placement Groups:
-----------------

	- Sometimes you want control over the EC2 instance placement strategy
	- That strategy can be defined using placement groups.
	- When you create a placement group, you can specify the following strategies for the group
		
		Cluster - EC2 clustered into a low-latency group in a single AZ
		Spread - Spreads instances across the underlying hardware (max 7 instances per group)
	- Not applicable to t2 instances.
	
Placement Groups Cluster:
==========================

	- Same AZ
	- Same Rack 
	
	Pros:
		
		- Great Network (10Gbps bandwidth between instances)
	
	Cons:
		
		- If the rack fails, all EC2 instances fail at the same time.
		
	Use cases:
	-----------
	
		- Big Data job that needs to complete fast
		- Application that needs extremely low latency and high network throughput.
		
	
Placement Groups Spread:
========================

Pros:
-----

	- Can span multiple AZ
	- Reduced risk of simultaneous failure
	
Cons:
-----

	- 7 instances per AZ per placement group
	
Use Cases:
----------
		
	- Application that needs high availability.
