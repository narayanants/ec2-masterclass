Referencing other Security Groups:
----------------------------------

 - It is possible to have security group rules using other security group instead of IP Ranges (CIDR) 
 
 - This is for enhanced security in AWS
 - The Security group can even reference itself
 
 
 Use cases:
 -----------
 
	- EC2 to EC2 direct communication within Security Groups
	- Public ELB - Private EC2 instances
	- Having rules that are more flexible than IP Ranges
