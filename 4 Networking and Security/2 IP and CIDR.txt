IP and CIDR:
-------------

	- Private IPs can allow certain values
	
		10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8) => Big Networks
		172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12) => Default AWS Zone
		192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16) => Home Networks
		
	- All the rest of the IP on the Internet is Public IP
	- Security Groups work the same way with public and or private IPs
	
	
Understaing CIDR:
------------------

	* 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.63 
	- CIDR is what we used for Security Groups Rules
	
		0.0.0.0/0 
		
CIDR Components:
=================

	- The Base IP (192.168.0.42)
	- Subnet Mask (/26)
	
	- Base IP represents the IP contained in the IP Range
	- Subnet masks define how many bits can change in the IP
	
	
	- Subnet Masks can take two forms:
	
		-255.255.255.0 
		- /24 
		
		
Quick Memo:
------------

	/32 - no IP number can change
	/24 - last IP number can change
	/16 - last IP 2 numbers can change
	/8 - last IP 3 numbers can change
	/0 - all IP numbers can change
