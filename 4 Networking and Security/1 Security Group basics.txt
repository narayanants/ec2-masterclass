Security Groups Overview:
=========================

	- Firewall on the EC2 instances
	- Regulate
	
		- Access to Ports
		- Authorized or Forbidden IPs - IPv4 or IPv6 
		- Control of InBound network (from other to the instance)
		- Control of the Outbound network ( From the instance to the other)

Good to Know:
=============

	- Can be attached to multiple instances
	- Locked down to a region / VPC combination
	- Does live outside the EC2 - if the traffic is blocked the instance won't see it.
	- Good practice to maintain one separate security group for SSH access.
	- If your app is not accessible, then its a security group issue.
	- If the app gives a connection refused error, its an application error.
	
	
	- By default, all inbound traffic is blocked
	- All outbound traffic is allowed.
